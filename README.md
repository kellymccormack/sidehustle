"# sidehustle" 

This project was completed in mid 2018 for Volusion. Given a static design, I was responsible for designing an interactive motion strategy for infographic and chart sections of a single page micro-site, building out the front end, and developing the animation.

This repo is a standalone instance that can run locally. Actual work was integrated by client using their own scrol-detection methods. ScrollMagic is used here to trigger animations for this demo.

Tech: extensive use of SVG, Greensock Animation Platform/GSAP, numerous CSS3 and JavaScript animation techniques, SASS, responsive, mobile device support.
